                        The purpose of this website is to promote the Inital Coin Offering / Release of Clarity's
                        new crypto valuta. It is a way for interested people to read about Clarity and the event itself,
                        buy tickets for the event, and to contact the organizers. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The goal for the website is to inform potential investors about the new release, enable ticket

                    <h2>Navigation Structure</h2>
                    <p>
                        The navigational aspect for the website is based on a Homepage with access to all the 
                        subpages using a navigation bar at top and a menu in the websites footer. The navigation bar
                        will be sticky when scrolling down the page, and will therefore be available for the user at
                        any given point of the vertical scroll-position of the website. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The menu will refer the users to the respective subpage with the href-attribute. This will
                        open the subpage in the same window. External link or URLs will take the user to a new window
                        for user-experience motivations. This will allow the user to visit external websites without
                        having to navigate to the same page in out website when done reading at the external website.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We believe this is the best way to structure our navigation because of the amount of subpages.
                        Having the navigation at the top of the screen and in the footer prevents the navbar in
                        distracting the user from the content of the page, while being available at any given time.
                    </p>
                    <p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">
                        This is the sitemap for our site:

                    <h2>The Design Manual</h2>
                    <p>
                        Our color palette is based on the color of the logo, and uses a Chestnut Red as a secondary color,
                        while the primary color is Chinese Black. We use a Yellow Orange color as an accent to give some variation
                        in the color tones shown in the website. This makes a common color-combination of black, yellow and red,
                        which is recogniseable from for instance the German flag. The reasoning behind the color palette is to give a
                        modern look, with great contrast in regards to universal design. It also provides room for sudden accents that
                        will give a neutral, but pleasing color-scheme to the website.
                    </p>
                    <p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">
                        This is the Color Palette of the website:
                    </p>
                    <img src="img/colorpalette.png" alt="Color palette" height="32%" width="48%">
                    <p>
                        We are planning on using the Montserrat font for the website, as it is a modern sans-serif-font
                        that is often used by new websites. It is minimalistic, and has a good readability while also being
                        good-looking and easy for the eye.
                    </p>
                    <p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">
                        This is the Typography of the website:

                    <p>
                        As fot the Logo and the elements they are primary red, an the CTA-design has a yellow onhover-effect
                        that will give a clear and nice contrast and feedback for the user. By having the CTA-buttons with border-radius,
                        we believe that it will make it clear that it is indeed a CTA, and that will be useful in regards to usability and
                        visibility aspects of the website.

                        no specific content, but modular blocks that represent elements in the website. It is meant
                        to be a visual guide for the website and to manage space when implementing the content.

                    <p>
                        As mention earlier, the site consists of 4 pages in total, including a Homepage, About us,
                        Contact and Ticket Shop with a ticket form. Below is a few screenshots of the design itself, following the design

                            This chapter will be a text-description of the pages shown above in "The Website Outlay"
                            It will consist of a written description of the elements, design guidelines and methods used
                            to acheive the desired design.
                        </p>
                        <div class="content-div"></div>
                            <h3>Comments : Design</h3>
                            <p>
                                The website uses a dark background, and strives to a minimalistic design with a red secondary color and uses yellow accents
                                to brighten the site up a little. One of the great advantages of using a minimalistic design is that the users have less elements
                                to control and manage when scanning the site. This will make it easier to find information, while also being aesthetically pleasing
                                fot the eye. We may face some problems regarding visibility, as space is a limited resource, and information needs to be sectioned and
                                categorized in such a way that it is easy and intuitive for the users to find the desired information. Be using a black main color with
                                a red and yellow elements and white text, it makes a quite big contrast, which will make it easier to read. Both the minimalistic design
                                and the color palettes is contributing to fulfilling the universal design for accessibility regarding users with handicaps. 
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    <div class="content-div">

                        <h3>Home</h3>
                        <p>
                            The homepage will be the index, where the users starts at when laoding the website. This will be the "hub"
                            that familiarizes the user to the inition design guidelines and concepts of the website. It is meant to
                            contain all the core content about the event itself, and it should be easy for the users to navigate to the 
                            other subpages from the homepage.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It constists of a navigation bar at the top, that will stay sticky for the entite vertical scroll position.
                            This is the same for all the pages, and it acts like a common navigation central for the user, at it is consistent
                            for all the pages. It also has a footer, which will also be in alle the other pages, and consists of a menu to the
                            other pages, and some other common footer-content such as copyright, logo and slogan.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For the relevant content of the page, it is split up in 3 different sections. These are: Header, split-section 1,
                            and split-section 2. The header will consist of a background image and some informative text about the event.
                            It is minimalistic, which prevents the users from getting overwhelmed when entering the site. Being designed in the way
                            it is, it will also give of a serious and elegent impression to the end user. The other two sections are a 50/50 split
                            section, where 50% of the viewport-width is going to be a image, and the other half text. To give a more modern and
                            non-repetetive look, the picture are alternated, such as the left-right in the firstoutlay are mirriored in the second.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-div">
                        <h3>About us</h3>
                        <p>
                            The About Us-page will also have a header, that will function as the header on the main page. This content is more
                            directed to the company itself, where the users can get familiar with the company and their story.
                            The sites sections are: header, split-section, text section 1 and text section 2. From header, to split sections, to pure
                            text-paragraph is a nice way to ease to user into more heavy reading. Because space is a limited resource in a minimalistic
                            design, we wanted to give the users as much information as possible, on a small area as possible. This is because we figured
                            that if the users already wants to learn more, they have no constraints on their willingness to read pure text, as in contrast
                            to fancy, space-consuming elements. To get a more modern design, we used assymmetrical headings, with an accent underline, that
                            gives off a sudden, but nice vibe to the headings and change of subject.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Ticket Shop</h3>
                        <p>
                            The Ticket shop is a simple shop, which consists of a sub-menu of the different tickets, and the ticket information itself.
                            We wanted to keep the design in line with the design manual, so we went for a minimalistic design which is kind of the outlay of
                            a paper ticket, to show the ticket type, price, infomation, and price. A CTA button is added on the ticket to indicate for the user
                            that by clicking the button, it will lead to the checkout area. To prevent false affordance, we chose to remove the other buttons,
                            as we dont want to frustrate the users by clicking the other CTA's that just leads to the same site, when the users actually wants to checkout.

                        <h3>Contact Page</h3>
                        <p>
                            The contact page is a non-scroll page, which consists of two elements: google maps and a contact form.
                            Having the form visible to the users on load makes it intuitive for the users of how to use the function.
                            The google maps is an API that uses google maps to pinpoint the location of the company. This is just a common
                            practise when building a contact page, and it is a page not out of the ordinary.

                        <h3>On-scroll Animations</h3>
                        <p>
                            The on-scroll animation will gradually show the content to the users when they scroll
                            through the website. This will be done using JavaScript, by adding an eventlistner and
                            change CSS-classes to determine the styling of the element using JS.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Form-validation and submission</h3>
                        <p>
                            The form-validation and submission functions will enable validation of the input data
                            from the user. This will enable us to secure that the data is in the right format when
                            sending it to the backend-server. The submission-function will be coded, but not implemented,
                            as the project is frontend only, and there wont be a backend server implemented.

                        <p>
                            The countdown timer will show the remaining time before the event starts, and we will set the
                            counter to count towards the project deadline. This will be done by using dynamic data fields that
                            are sent by JavaScript functions by getting the current time and displaying that on the website.
                            <br><br>
                            The ticket-counter will count the remaining tickets for each category. This will be reset each time
                            the user enters the page, as there are no safe way to store the data over time. This will be done by
                            using JavaScript-functions that will track the amount of times "Buy tickets" are clicked for each
                            category, and then update the variable.

                        <h3>Dynamic content / Ticket-carousel</h3>
                        <p>
                            The tickets will be shown for a given time period before changing to the next type. This will be
                            triggered on load, and if someone press one of the ticket-types in the "ticket menu" then it will be
                            turned off. This is due to usability, as you dont want it to change if for instance youre reading the
                            ticket-information. This will be done using Javascript by combining a timer-function with change of
                            the display attribute of each ticket type. More advanced animations may be implemented if we have time.

                            Will show the user the location of the company, it this case this will be Gløshaugen. This will be done
                            using javascript and the Google Maps API, that will be implemented in the contact page with a HTML-snippet
                            provided by Google, and by mark the map using Javascript-functions.

                    <p>
                        The code will be handled with GitHub, that provides easier communication and version controlling.
                        For the website, we will start by making the Header and the Footer as theyre used in every page,
                        then we will make the skeleton code for the website, by splitting them into rows and columns according
                        to the design mentioned earlier. Then we will implement the design in code. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We have decided to split the workload into 2 pages each, as it is 4 pages in total. We will try to mak
                        the common elements first, and then use seperate css-sheets for each for the pages, and then combining them.
                        This requires good communication, but we are striving to work in-person together, as this is the best way.

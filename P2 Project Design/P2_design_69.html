                        The purpose of this website is to promote the Inital Coin Offering / Release of Clarity's
                        new crypto valuta. It is a way for interested people to read about Clarity and the event itself,
                        buy tickets for the event, and to contact the organizers. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The goal for the website is to inform potential investors about the new release, enable ticket 
                        purchasing and for people to be able to contact Clarity via a contact form
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The audience is crypto bros, potential investors and in general people who are interested in crypto and
                        finance.

                    <h2>Navigation Structure</h2>
                    <p>
                        The navigational aspect for the website is based on a Homepage with access to all the 
                        subpages using a navigation bar at top and a menu in the websites footer. The navigation bar
                        will be sticky when scrolling down the page, and will therefore be available for the user at
                        any given point of the vertical scroll-position of the website. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The menu will refer the users to the respective subpage with the href-attribute. This will
                        open the subpage in the same window. External link or URLs will take the user to a new window
                        for user-experience motivations. This will allow the user to visit external websites without
                        having to navigate to the same page in out website when done reading at the external website.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We believe this is the best way to structure our navigation because of the amount of subpages.
                        Having the navigation at the top of the screen and in the footer prevents the navbar in
                        distracting the user from the content of the page, while being available at any given time.
                    </p>
                    <p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">
                        This is the sitemap for our site:

                    <h2>The Design Manual</h2>
                    <p>
                        Our color palette is based on the color of the logo, and uses a Chestnut Red as a secondary color,
                        while the primary color is Chinese Black. We use a Yellow Orange color as an accent to give some variation
                        in the color tones shown in the website. This makes a common color-combination of black, yellow and red,
                        which is recogniseable from for instance the German flag. The reasoning behind the color palette is to give a
                        modern look, with great contrast in regards to universal design. It also provides room for sudden accents that
                        will give a neutral, but pleasing color-scheme to the website.
                    </p>
                    <p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">
                        This is the Color Palette of the website:
                    </p>
                    <img src="img/colorpalette.png" alt="Color palette" height="32%" width="48%">
                    <p>
                        We are planning on using the Montserrat font for the website, as it is a modern sans-serif-font
                        that is often used by new websites. It is minimalistic, and has a good readability while also being
                        good-looking and easy for the eye.
                    </p>
                    <p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">
                        This is the Typography of the website:

                    <p>
                        As fot the Logo and the elements they are primary red, an the CTA-design has a yellow onhover-effect
                        that will give a clear and nice contrast and feedback for the user. By having the CTA-buttons with border-radius,
                        we believe that it will make it clear that it is indeed a CTA, and that will be useful in regards to usability and
                        visibility aspects of the website.

                        The wireframe was designed to give a general outlay of the website in form of a sketch with
                        no specific content, but modular blocks that represent elements in the website. It is meant
                        to be a visual guide for the website and to manage space when implementing the content.

                        As mention earlier, the site consists of 4 pages in total, including a Homepage, About us,
                        Contact and Ticket Shop with a ticket form. Below is a few screenshots of the design itself, following the design

                            The on-scroll animation will gradually show the content to the users when they scroll
                            through the website. This will be done using JavaScript, by adding an eventlistner and
                            change CSS-classes to determine the styling of the element using JS.
                        </p>

                            from the user. This will enable us to secure that the data is in the right format when
                            sending it to the backend-server. The submission-function will be coded, but not implemented,
                            as the project is frontend only, and there wont be a backend server implemented.

                            The countdown timer will show the remaining time before the event starts, and we will set the
                            counter to count towards the project deadline. This will be done by using dynamic data fields that
                            are sent by JavaScript functions by getting the current time and displaying that on the website.
                            <br><br>
                            The ticket-counter will count the remaining tickets for each category. This will be reset each time
                            the user enters the page, as there are no safe way to store the data over time. This will be done by
                            using JavaScript-functions that will track the amount of times "Buy tickets" are clicked for each
                            category, and then update the variable.

                            The tickets will be shown for a given time period before changing to the next type. This will be
                            triggered on load, and if someone press one of the ticket-types in the "ticket menu" then it will be
                            turned off. This is due to usability, as you dont want it to change if for instance youre reading the
                            ticket-information. This will be done using Javascript by combining a timer-function with change of
                            the display attribute of each ticket type. More advanced animations may be implemented if we have time.

                            Will show the user the location of the company, it this case this will be Gløshaugen. This will be done
                            using javascript and the Google Maps API, that will be implemented in the contact page with a HTML-snippet
                            provided by Google, and by mark the map using Javascript-functions.

                    <p>
                        The code will be handled with GitHub, that provides easier communication and version controlling.
                        For the website, we will start by making the Header and the Footer as theyre used in every page,
                        then we will make the skeleton code for the website, by splitting them into rows and columns according
                        to the design mentioned earlier. Then we will implement the design in code. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We have decided to split the workload into 2 pages each, as it is 4 pages in total. We will try to mak
                        the common elements first, and then use seperate css-sheets for each for the pages, and then combining them.
                        This requires good communication, but we are striving to work in-person together, as this is the best way.

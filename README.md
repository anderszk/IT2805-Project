<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This the repository for our website-development project in the subject IT2805 Webtechnologies, which constisted of designing, implementing and testing a website from scratch. In the repository you will find: The project description, design manual, prototypes, the source code and the deliverables for the project.

The website was made for a fictional company named Clarity, which is a crypto currency company. The website is meant to be a landing page for the event itself and to offer tickets and a channel to contact the company itself. It contains 4 pages, including a Homepage, About us-page, Ticket Shop and a Contact Page. There are other concepts we wanted to implement, but we were 2 people on the group, meaning we had to have a reasonable work-load in regards to time management.


We used HTML5/CSS3/JS to implement the concepts, as framworks such as react.js were not allowed.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This repository is containg all the code and documention for our project for direction finding using an 1x2 antenna patch array mounted on a robotic arm with three DOF. We are implementing the program using C and Nordic Semiconductor's SDK. The ```code```-folder contains the source code, excluding the build as you will need to do this by yourself when testing the system. This program is applied to our specific system, which is described under prerequisites.

We have used the nRF52832 DK and are currently working on making the code more dynamic, so it can be used on other development kits, such as nRF52840. Most of the code regarding BLE are used from the example codes in the SDK, and we have focused on developing the algorithms used to maneuver the servo, reading the enocder and the searching algorithm itself.

You can find the .3mf files for our self made robotic arm parts on [Printables.com](https://www.printables.com/social/218149-haavardok/about). There you can find all the files needed to print the parts used in this project. We used a Prusa Mini for 3D-printing where most of the parts were printed with PLA on 0.10 mm layer height and ~20 % infill. Some parts as the axle from the first servo to the next were printed with 100 % infill for structural integrity reasons.

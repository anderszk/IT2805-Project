                <h2>Comments</h2>
                <p>We got rewarded by putting effort into the prototype and design, at it was easily implemented
                    in code because of the detailed and clear design. By making a prototype we could test the
                    functionality and make sure that we got everything planned beforehand. We kept the design
                    primarly to the prototype with minimal devience. We also ended up with the same amount of pages
                    hat we originally planned with. <br><br>
                    If we could improve something, it would have been refactoring code in the .html- and .css-files.
                    We could have made mgeneral css-classes so the file would have been shorter. Because the use of Bootstrap
                    and Tailwind libraries were restricted, we decided that this was an issue of lower priority.<br><br>
                    We used modularity for the navigation bar, which resulted in a really clean html-code for the navbar with
                    just an empty div. This felt kind of like very scuffed React, and we decided on not continue using it for
                    the footer and the rest as it is tideous work with little to gain.                    
                </p>

                <h2>Change 1: Remove Footer CTA</h2>
                <p>As we used CTA's throughout the whole front-page, and the header is sticky, we decided on not
                    including it in the footer. For the visibility and affordance of the site, we concluded with
                    the footer CTA not being a cruical element as there is a CTA in the header. It would make more
                    noise than helping the user, which in generel is a bad thing. It also made the footer more airy,
                    which aestethically looks better.
                </p>

                <h2>Change 2: Add Timer to Homepage</h2>
                <p>Because we needed JavaScript functions, we though that it would be nice with a countdown-timer, as
                    this is an event. It would add some motion to the home-page which also would deliver the information
                    in an appropriate way without bringing noise, as the element is rather small. This was done using the
                    Date-function in JS.
                </p>

                <h2>Change 3: Add sub-menu to ticket</h2>
                <p>We originially decided on going for a conventional carousel with arrows. This is a method that is well known
                    by users and would be fine. The disadvantage with using a carousel is that it would show little to none visibility
                    of the ticket-options. As the design layout for the tickets are the same, we found it more usefull using a sub-menu
                    that will display all the options to the user, and rather animate the carousel-effect using JavaScript.
                </p>

                <h2>Change 4: Added dedicated .js-file for <br>contactInfo and modules</h2>
                <p>To have a better overview of the functionality, we decided on adding a dedicated JavaScript-file for the contact info.
                    By doing this, we could organize the code in a better way, and not having to load the file on every page, effectively
                    increasing the performance of the site. <br><br>
                    The same arguments applies to the decision of making a dedicated file for the modules. 
                </p>

                <h2>Change 5: Colors of the menu-items</h2>
                <p>We decided on making the menu-items red. On hover, it will lower its opacity and have an underline. When active (current site),
                    it will be yellow (seondary color). This will help increase the affordance of the navbar, while also increasing universal design
                    by adding more contrast to the different states. This was applied on both the navbar, and footer-menu.

          <p class="aboutP" style="width: 40vw; margin-left: 0%;">Clarity (CLTY) is a peer-to-peer, open-source
            cryptocurrency. It is considered an altcoin and is to be launched soon in the upcoming ICO with the characteristic C 
            as its logo. Clarity's blockchain has merit with its underlying technology derived from Litecoin.
            Notable features of Clarity, which uses a scrypt algorithm, are its low price and unlimited supply.</p>

        <p class="aboutP">The term shitcoin refers to a cryptocurrency with little to no value or a digital currency
          that has no immediate, discernible purpose. The word is a pejorative term often used to describe altcoins or
          cryptocurrencies that were developed after bitcoins became popular.
          <br><br>
          The diminished value of a shitcoin is often due to failed investor interest because it was not created in good
          faith or because its price was based on speculation. As such, these currencies are considered to be bad
          investments.

        </div>
        <p class="aboutP">Interest in cryptocurrencies increased substantially since bitcoins were introduced in 2009.
          Their success has drawn in businesses looking to take advantage of blockchain technology to create their own
          altcoins, which are digital assets that piggyback off the basic design of bitcoin. Developers typically
          announce how many tokens are ultimately made available—the supply of bitcoin is capped at 21 million, while
          ether supplies are capped at 18 million per year.
          <br><br>
          Setting a supply limit creates scarcity, as investors understand that additional tokens will not be created
          after a certain point. More tokens would theoretically dilute the value of their holdings, the same way a new
          stock issuance may reduce the value of a share of stock.
          <br><br>
          With the supply of an altcoin fixed, its value should be dependent on demand. But since most cryptocurrencies
          have limited practical use—buying and selling real-world goods and services using cryptocurrencies is not yet
          a common occurrence—their values are based on pure speculation. Therefore, a shitcoin is something people say
          is valuable simply because it exists.

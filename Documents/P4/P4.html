        <h1> P4: Usertesting </h1>
        <p>
            For usertesting the goal is to find the most suitable subjects. For our project, that would be possible investors.
            For this reason the subjects were asked about previous investments in traditional assets and other cryptocurrencies, as this
            would paint a picture of their willingness to explore new opportunities. Here is a graph over the results.

            The test-subjects were informed of different problems before gaining access to the webpage 
            <ul>
                <li>Du lurer på når eventet er og hvor lenge det er til.</li>

                    <li> lurer på hva Calrity er og bestemmer deg for å lese mer om det.</li>
                    
                    <li> synes dette virker interessant og velger og kjøpe en voksenbillett</li>
                    
                    <li> lurer på om arrangementet tillater hunder, send inn en melding med spørsmål.</li>
            </ul>
            Here are the results of the user-testing:

            The results of the user-testing show that the webpage is working well. The most important functions such as the sale of new tickets
            were no problem for any of the participants. Something that came up more than once was the fact that nowhere on the page is the 
            exact time of the event stated. This needs improvement. As it turns out, the place where more info about the Clarity project specifically
            can be found, was a bit harder to find than expected. Despite this the results were very positive overall.
